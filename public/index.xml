      <title>Post #3: Polling</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many, polling is considered the foundation of electoral predictions. However, its predictive power may be significantly less reliable than expected. In this week’s post, I explore this by creating a few predictive models for national and state races using only polling data, and I analyze the results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite polling’s prominence, the circumstances surrounding this election make data particularly limited. Since President Biden exited the race in mid-July, there are only eight weeks of polling data available that directly compares the current two candidates. This data spans from 15 weeks before the election to 7 weeks prior, which presents some challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Post #2: Modeling Using the Economy</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The economy is often cited as a core &amp;lsquo;fundamental&amp;rsquo; in predicting election outcomes. A strong economy typically suggests that the incumbent party is likely to win and vice versa. In some elections, like in 1980, where rampant inflation—significantly rising gas prices—dominated, it was clear that incumbent Jimmy Carter would lose due to the weak economy. However, in other elections, such as 2012 or 2016, it was less clear whether the economy was strong enough to predict an incumbent party victory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Post #1: Defining the Swing States</title>
      <link>https://example.org/post/2024/09/09/post-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the first of a series of blog posts in which I will analyze and predict the 2024 Presidential Election. In my first post, I will analyze historical data from past presidential elections to determine how competitive presidential elections are, what states can be seen as reliable for either party, while what states are considered swing states.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-states-are-competitive&#34;&gt;What states are competitive?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To begin, I will examine the vote margins for each state in the Democratic and Republican parties&amp;rsquo; presidential elections from 2000 to 2020. A brief overview shows that even the most partisan states had relatively close margins. Excluding D.C., every state was within 30 percentage points, and most were within 15 points. However, under the U.S. Electoral College system, whether state margins are 80-20 or 52-48, if they consistently vote for the same party, the margin does not affect the overall election outcome. The only states that genuinely impact the result are those with razor-thin margins capable of switching sides, and these states tend to be nearly white on the electoral map below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
