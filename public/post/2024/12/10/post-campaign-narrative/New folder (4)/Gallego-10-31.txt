 hola
 Arizona it is good to see you all good
 to see everyone what a great concert I
 had flash uh flashbacks to Saturday
morning and the smell of pine so and my
 mom tell me wake up and start
 cleaning if you're Latino you know what
 I'm talking about
 right look in the last week I've been
 crisscrossing this state PE and presc
 Yuma San Louise and let me tell you
 arizonans are ready to make their voices
 heard for those who don't know me I'm
 Ren GGO I'm a dad a husband the son of
 immigrants a congressman and a proud
 Marine but even prouder
 arizonan and hopefully in just five days
 five days your next United States
 Senator and the first Latino senator in
 the history of
Arizona for 22 months I've traveled this
state and and I've gone everywhere and I
 talk to everyone because I'm running to
 represent all of Arizona Republicans
 Democrats and independents
 alike because here's what I know and
 here's what I've learned that we all
 have so much in common we all want to
 defend our freedoms including the right
 to an
 abortion we want to take care of our
 seniors and our veterans and to give our
 our kids the best possible
 future this is what this campaign is
 about and that is why I'm running to
 represent you I first ran for office 15
 years ago and I've been fighting for AR
 resonance ever since in the state house
 then in
 Congress but before that I sign the DI
 line at the age of 20 and joined the
 United States Marine
 Corps as a
 there's always some Marines at the crowd
 right I wanted to serve the greatest
 country in the world the country that
 gave me a shot at the American dream
 that gave my whole family a chance to
 truly live and Thrive because only in
 America can a kid who slept on the floor
 and only got a bed when I got to my
 first college dorm room bed can someone
 like that run to represent this state in
 the in the
 Senate
 only in
 America only in America can four
 children raised by an immigrant single
 mom on a secretary salary grow up to
become teachers a doctor a businesswoman
and soon to be a senator only in
 America in America
 Senor that is why I'm running this is
 why I'm running because every kid in
 Arizona deserves the same chance to make
 it that I had they all deserve that
 chance
 so for my daughter Isa who deserves the
 same rights that her grandmother had
 let's fight for
 mine for moms like mine who fought just
 to survive another day for her kids to
 make it into the future let's fight for
 my son Michael who deserves the
brightest future I can get him let's
 fight
 so Arizona we have a few more days to go
 so get in the fight make your voices
 heard my wife Sydney and I proudly voted
 just a few days
 ago that feeling of taking action to
 build a better future for my kids for
 your kids it does not get any better
 than that 5 days Arizona it's time to
 get the job
 done arizonans are already voting but we
 need to push a little more work a little
 harder and run through that finish line
 so here's what we're going to do vote
 and vote now drop off your Ballot or
 vote in person and then go tell your
 friends your family and your neighbors
 to do the same and then when you're done
go knock some more doors make some calls
 whatever it
takes
 is because if we do that if we do that
together if we fight together we can
 number one defeat Carrie
 Lake number
 two defeat Donald
 Trump number three fight for a better
 future cuz we are fighting to protect
 our democracy our freedoms and our
 future and the only way forward the only
way forward is to elect KLA Harris as
 our next president and Tim RS as our
 next vice president and cast that vote
now Arizona
