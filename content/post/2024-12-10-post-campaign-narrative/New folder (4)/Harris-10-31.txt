it's very clear to all of us is here
when you know what you stand for you
know what to fight
for and we love our country and we love
our country and we know in this election
we have an opportunity to turn the page
on a decade of Donald Trump trying to
keep us divided and afraid of each other
we're done with that we're exhausted
with that
and we know and we know that's who he is
but Phoenix that is not who we are that
is not who we
are and it is time for a new generation
of leadership in
America and I am ready to offer that
leadership as the next president of the
United States
in Arizona many of you know me I'm not
afraid of tough
fights for decades I was a prosecutor I
was the top law enforcement officer of
the biggest state in our country and I
have won fights I won fights against the
big banks that ripped off homeowners
against for profit colleges that scam
dammed veterans and students against
predators who Abused Women and
Children and we are fighting for
democracy and that's all right that's
all
right democracy can be complicated but
we believe in democracy and the right of
everyone to have their voices heard
it's all
right and I have fought for many who
have harmed other human beings I have
fought against the cartels that
trafficked in guns drugs and human
beings and it is my pledge to you that
if you give me the chance to fight on
your behalf as president there is
nothing in the world that will stand in
my way
and look we all know who Donald Trump is
this is
not because here's the thing we all know
he is not someone who is thinking about
how to make your life better this is
someone who is
unstable obsessed with
Revenge consumed with grievance and out
for unchecked
power and and in less than 90 days it
will either be him or me in the Oval
Office yes we're going to get this
done and and I thank you I thank you and
here's the thing because we're really
clear and we can all picture it we can
picture the oval office right and if he
is elected on day one Donald Trump would
walk into that office with an enemies
list on day one when I am elected I will
walk in with a to-do
list and on top of my list is bringing
down they see
yes and on top of my list in that spirit
is bringing down your cost of living
it's an issue that we need to address
and it will be my focus every single day
as president I will give a middle class
tax cut to over 100 million Americans I
will
enact I will enact the first ever
Federal ban on corporate price gouging
on
groceries I will fight to make sure that
hardworking Americans can actually
afford a place to
live and if you are caring for an
elderly parent look I took care of my
mother when she a sick if you are taking
care of an elderly parent I understand
what you are experiencing and my plan
will cover the cost of care under
Medicare for the seniors in your life
who need help and
support because so much of my plan for
me is about the dignity that all people
deserve which is why my plan in
includes lowering the cost of child care
cutting taxes for small businesses and
lowering health care cost do we have
small businesses in the
house I will focus on health care
because this is where I come from I
believe Access to Health Care should be
a right and not just a privilege of
those who can afford it
on the other hand Donald Trump's answer
to the hey guys you know what here's the
thing let's talk for a moment about Gaza
we all want this war to end and get the
hostages
out and I will work on it fulltime when
I am elected president as I've been
and I have
yours so there's a contrast in this
election on so many issues including our
plans for America's economy Donald
Trump's answer to the financial
pressures you face is the same as the
last time another trillion dollars in
tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest
corporations and this time he will pay
for
it and this time his plan is a 20%
national sales tax on everything you buy
that is imported clothes food toys cell
phones a trump sales tax according to
the economist would cost the average
American family an additional $4,000 a
year and on top of that Donald Trump
still wants to get rid of the Affordable
Care Act also known as Obamacare and he
has a powerful friend in Congress the
Speaker of the House who recently said
if Trump wins there will be quote no
Obamacare which would throw understand
the meaning of that it would throw
millions of Americans off of their
health insurance and take us back to the
time which we remember when insurance
companies could deny people with
pre-existing
conditions well we are not going back we
are not going back we're not going back
we are not
going we're not going back we're not
going and we are not going back because
ours is a fight for the future and it is
a fight for
Freedom like the fundamental freedom of
a woman to make decisions about her own
body and not have her government tell
her what to
do and remember how we got here Don
Donald Trump hands elected three members
of the United States Supreme Court with
the intention that they would undo the
protections of roie Wade and they did as
he intended and now in America one in
three women lives in a state with a
trump abortion ban many with no
exceptions even for rape and incest
which is
immoral and and and and Donald Trump's
not done did everyone hear with he just
said
yesterday that he will do what he wants
quote and here's where I'm going to
quote whether the women like it or
not
and and we must vote because this is the
thing you know there's a saying that you
got to listen to people when they tell
you who you are who they are and this is
not the first time he has told us who he
is he does not believe women should have
the agency and authority to make
decisions about their own bodies this is
the same man who said women should be
punished for their
choices he simply does not respect the
freedom of women or the intelligence of
women to know what's in their own best
interest and make decisions accordingly
but we trust women we trust
women which is why yes we will vote
because we also understand if he was
elected he has been pretty clear in his
behavior and his deeds he will ban
abortion Nationwide he will restrict
access to birth control put IVF
treatments at risk and force states to
monitor women's pregnancies and you
don't have to take my word for it just
Google project
2025 read the plans for
yourself and I think everyone here knows
that we can agree one does not have to
abandon their faith or deeply held
beliefs to agree the government
shouldn't be telling her what to do not
the
government not the
government so Arizona to protect your
right to make your own health care
decisions I would recommend you vote Yes
on proposition
139 and make sure you vote up and down
the ballot to truly protect that
right and it is my pledge to you you
when Congress passes a bill to restore
reproductive Freedom as president of the
United States I will proudly sign it
into
law
proudly so Arizona I'm here to ask for
your
vote which I would be so honored to have
and here is my pledge to you as
president I pledge to you to seek common
ground and Common Sense solutions to the
challenges you
face I will tell you I am not looking to
score political points I am looking to
make progress I pledge to you to listen
to experts to listen to those who will
be impacted by the decisions I make and
I pledge to you to listen to people who
disagree with
me and unlike Donald Trump I don't
believe that people who disagree with me
are the
enemy who he wants to put them in jail
I'll give them a seat at the
table cuz that's how a democracy
works and that's how real leaders work
and I pledge to you to always put
country above party and above self and
to be a president for all
Americans that is my sincere pledge to
you and so Phoenix with five days left
in this campaign my opponent is also
making his closing argument to
America and you've probably seen a bit
of it it is an argument that is full of
hate and division he insults Latinos
scapegoats immigrants and it's not just
what he says it's what he will do if
elected you can be sure he will bring
back family separation
policies only on a much greater scale
than last time and it is time then to
turn Turn the page on Donald Trump we
are done with
that so five days out and it all comes
down to this we are here together and
you all have taken time out of all the
demands on your life and your busy
schedules you have taken the time to be
here because I know we all love our
country we we love our country we love
our
country and when you love something you
fight for it you fight for
it and with that spirit and with this
Spirit we know know that one of the
highest forms of patriotism the love
that we have for our country is to then
fight for its ideals and to fight to
realize the promise of America that's
what this is about and I have always
believed in our nation's promise because
I have lived it I grew up as a child of
the Civil Rights Movement my parents
would take me to marches when I was in a
stroller and
people during that time would come
together from every Walk of Life
together from every background every
race and come together to fight for
freedom and
opportunity growing up when I was
growing up I saw how hard my mother
worked to give her two daughters the
same chances our country gave her and I
was blessed to have family by Blood
and to have family by love who
instilled who instilled in me the values
of community and
compassion and Faith I've spent my life
fighting for people who have been hurt
and counted out but never stopped
believing that anything in our country
is possible I have lived the promise of
a America and today I see the promise of
America in everyone here in all of you I
see the promise of
America in the women who refuse to
accept the future without reproductive
freedom and the men who support
them in the fathers and mothers who work
hard every day for their children's
future in Republicans who have never
voted for a Democrat before but put the
Constitution of the United States before
party and I see the promise of America
in all the young leaders who are voting
for the first time where are you let me
see you
and I love this generation of leaders
you are
rightly I mean you guys are rightly
impatient for
change and you are determined to live
free from gun violence to tackle the
climate crisis to shake the world you
inherit and for our young leaders here's
the thing none of this is theoretical
for them it's not political for you all
it is your lived
experience and I see you and I see your
incredible power and I am so proud of
you so can we hear it for the first time
voters who are here
although why aren't you guys in
class it's
okay so Arizona we have five days to get
this done and no one can sit on the
sidelines let's spend the next five days
so that when we look back on these five
days we'll know we did everything we
could so let's knock on doors let's text
and call voters let's reach out to
family and friends and Neighbors and
co-workers and classmates and as we do
here is my request let us please be
intentional about building Community let
us
be intentional about building coalitions
you know there's been so much about
these last several years that is making
people feel
alone making people Point their fingers
at each other as though we're not all in
this together so let's approach this
with the spirit that is about bringing
folks back together and reminding
everyone the vast majority of us have so
much more in common than what separates
us so let's approach it that
way let's approach it that way we will
be the stronger for
it and always remember your vote is your
voice and your voice is your power
so Arizona today I ask you are you ready
to make your voices
heard do we believe in
Freedom do we believe in
Opportunity do we believe in the promise
of
America and are we ready to fight for it
and when we fight we win God bless you
and God bless the United States
